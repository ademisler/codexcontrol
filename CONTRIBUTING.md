## Pull Request Guidance

- Keep changes scoped and reviewable.
- Do not commit real account data, `auth.json`, snapshots, or screenshots with real user identities.
- Prefer synthetic demo data for UI assets and documentation.
- Reuse the shared logo and mark assets under [`site/assets`](./site/assets) instead of creating ad-hoc variants.
- If you touch quota logic, include the exact scenario you validated.
- If you touch switching logic, describe the expected desktop restart behavior and any platform-specific global state or session cache handling.

## Before Opening a PR

- Build the macOS app successfully.
- Run Windows tests in an isolated environment if you changed the Windows implementation.
- Regenerate release artifacts if you changed packaging or release-facing assets.
- Re-check the repository for absolute local paths, real customer emails, token-like strings, or live desktop session snapshots.
